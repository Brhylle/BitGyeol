# 🏠 BitGyeol (빛결) : An Automated Smart Home System Using Motorized, Light-Aware Technology

## 📖 Overview
This project is initiated as a _case study_ to uncover how **adaptive street and house lights & controlled/automatic doors** work under the hood using a prototype, the proponents used a merged inputs of using a **light-detecting resistor** and **real-time clock module**, and **servo motors** to mimic the opening and closing of doors.

## 🚀 Features
✅ CLI-Controlled – our prototype is controlled via Serial Monitors for the time being.
✅ Manual / Automatic 
✅ Feature 3 – Briefly describe
